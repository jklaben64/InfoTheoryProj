I'm so tired of being here

C    -    C          C    C   C    E-E-G   E-D-C
Suppressed by all my childish fears

And if you have to leave

G   G      F       E       D           E      F-E
I wish that you would just leave

E              G        G  -  G        G      G - E     G
'Cause your presence still lingers here

G      G    G          G      B    ^C-^C
And it won't leave me alone...

These wounds won't seem to heal,

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears

You used to captivate me by your resonating light

Now, I'm bound by the life you left behind

G          G     F     E-D      G       F      ED-EF        E
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams

G          G       F         E      D - E   G   G   G-G-B  ^C ^C
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me...

But though you're still with me,

I've been alone all along...
