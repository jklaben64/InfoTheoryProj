How can you see into my eyes

Like open doors?

B  -  A      ^D     ^C     B-A    B     G
Leading you down into my core

Where I've become so numb...

Until you find it there and lead me

Now that I know what I'm without

You can't just leave me...

Frozen inside, without your touch

Without your love  ~  darling

Among the dead...
