Somebody once told me

G     ^C      B   B-A      A    G
The world is gonna roll me

G ^C     B          B-A        A     G   A    E-D
I   ain't the sharpest tool in the shed...

 

G       G    ^D-B        B      A     A
She was looking kind of dumb

G      G    ^C- B    B      A        A
With her finger and her thumb

G  G      ^C      B   A   A   G    A         E-D
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead...

 

G         G      G         G        G-G
Well the years start coming

G      E         G        G        B-G
And they don't stop coming

G      G   G       G       G  E G    G         G            B-G
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

B-B        ^D       ^C      B    G    A     G    G
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

G           B        G       G         G       E        G        G      E-D
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb...

 

G      B     G    ^D    G     B    G   ^D
So much to do, so much to see

G     ^D         ^C         B        A-A       G      A           G
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

E           G-G        G    G     G     G      G
You'll never know if you don't go

G           B-G       G     G     E      G       E-D
You'll never shine if you don't glow!

And all that glitters is gold

G-G        A-G       B-A      A        G    A-B-E
Only shooting stars break the mold!

 

G   G   G         G       G     G      G   G   G      G-G
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

G               G-G       G     G        G      G    G     G   B-G
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older

G      G    B-^C-D   ^C      B     A   A-G
But the  meteor   men beg to differ

G-G         G     G     B    G   G    G-G-G       E-D
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

 

E      G   B      ^D    G    B-G      G-G    E-D
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin

G       G-G          G-G         B       G    G       B        G    G     E-D
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

G       G        B    ^D-^D    G    E-G    E-D
My world's on fire, how about yours?

G          G     G    G    B   G
That's the way I like it

G    G    B-G    G     E-D
And I never get bored
