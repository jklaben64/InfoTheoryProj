Bb A F# G
(Intro tune)

C# C# C# C#-C#
Lead to the river

E - E - E         E       E
Midsummer I waved

F#  F# F#  F#    F#
A â€˜V' of black swans

E       F#      G#  G#  A   G-G#
On with hope to the grave

E             G#       F#     E-G#-F#-E
And through Red September

E         G#   F#-E   F#-G#
With skies fire-paved

G#    A        A       A       A-A-G#
I begged you would appear

G#   F#   G#  G#   B  G#-F#   E
Like a thorn for the holy ones

 

 

Bb         A     G       F
Bared on your tomb

G   A    Bb       A      G     ^C-Bb-A
I'm a prayer for your loneliness

A        Bb       Bb    A-G     F
And would you ever soon

G            A-Bb   A-G  ^C
Come above unto me?

 

A     Bb     Bb-A  G   F
For once upon a time

A           F       G      A     G    ^C-^D-^D
From the binds of your lowliness

Bb  Bb    A-G       F
I could always find

G        A      Bb     A    G   ^C-Bb-A   G
The right slot for your sacred key...
