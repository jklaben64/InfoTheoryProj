F  A   G     F
I sit and wait

A      ^C  ^D-^C    A-^C-^D   ^C  ^C
Does an angel contemplate my fate

F        A      G        F
And do they know

F         A-G        A        G    A
The places where we go

A             G          A     ^C   ^C
When we're grey and old?

F             A       G       F
Cause I've been told

A      ^C-^D-^C     A   ^C    ^D     ^C-^C
That salvation lets their wings unfold

 

F       G      A    Bb-A  Bb  A  Bb
So when I'm lying in my bed

F                      Bb-A          Bb        A      Bb
Thoughts running through my head

Bb Bb  Bb    A     A    G    A
And I feel the love is dead

Bb  Bb-Bb   A-G      F - F
I'm loving angels instead

 

F           A     ^C  ^G
And through it all

^G  ^G-^F  ^G  ^F-^A-^G
She offers me protection

^F  ^F ^F  ^F   ^F  ^D-^G-^F
A  lot  of  love  and  affection

^D-^D     ^D    ^D   ^C   ^C
Whether I'm right or wrong

 

F         A       A    ^C-^C-^G
And down the waterfall

^G-^G-^F  ^G   ^F   ^A  ^G
Wherever  it  may  take  me

^F  ^F   ^F   ^F   ^F    ^D-^G-^F
I know that life won't break me

^D   ^D   ^D  ^C  ^C
When I come to call

A          A        F - A      G
She won't forsake me

Bb   Bb-Bb   A-G     F - F
I'm loving angels instead...
