If you, if you could return

A          A   B   B-A
Don't let it burn

A        A    B   B-A
Don't let it fade

A       B     A    B   ^D-^D  ^E-^D
I'm sure I'm not being rude

A      A     B       A     B-^D-^E
But it's just your attitude

^D  ^E-^D  ^E ^F#-^F#
It's tearing me apart

B    ^E-^D   ^E-^F#-^D
It's ruining everything...

 

A    A
I swore

A     A     A     A     B    B-A
I swore I would be true

A        B - A     B    A    B
And honey, so did you

A    B-A     A       A      B-^D    A   ^E-^D
So why were you holding her hand?

A    B    ^D  ^D  ^D  ^E-^D
Is that the way we stand?

^D   ^D ^E-^D ^E ^F# ^F#-^D
Were you lying all the time?

B     B   ^E  ^D  ^E  ^F#  ^D
Was it just a game to you?

^D ^D ^B-^A ^E ^F#
But I'm in so deep...

 

^F# ^F# ^F# ^E ^F# ^F# ^F# ^E
You know I'm such a fool for you

^D       ^E    ^D       ^E       ^D-^E    ^F#   ^G-^F#-^E
You've got me wrapped around your finger  ~

^D-A-B-A
Ahhhh

^E  ^F#  ^G  ^F# ^E ^F# ^D-B
Do you have to let it linger?

B       B     ^G  ^F#   B    B   ^G ^F#
Do you have to, do you have to,

B      B  ^G ^F# ^E ^F# ^E-^D
Do have to let it linger?
