My tea's gone cold

B     A  -   G        BG  A F#  G    B   F#  A  E
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all

E      B  -  B      B      B         A   G     B-G-A
The morning rain clouds up my window

A     ^D ^E   B    A  B
And I can't see at all

A   ^D^D-^D^D B      BG   B   G  A
And even if I could it'd all be grey

G     A       B -^C   B  B-A  B
But your picture on my wall

E   B - A      G     G     A   B    G   A
It reminds me that it's not so bad

E     B    G   AGE
It's not so bad ~

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay

F#  G       B      F#   A  E
My head just feels in pain

E B          B    B     B      A          G   B     G-A
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today

A     ^D ^E B        A - B
I'm late for work again

A    ^D-^D ^D ^D A        G         B  G - A
And even if I'm there they'll all imply

G      A B        ^C     B      A   B
That I might not last the day

E       B      A    G    E     G    B    G   A
Then you call me and it's not so bad

E   B    G   AGE
it's not so bad ~

And    I     want to thank you

E     E-E     E    E     G    G^D ^D^D A
For giving me the best day  of  my  life

E ^D^G   B     G  A   B      G
Oh   ~    just to be with you

E  E-E       E    G     G^D ^D^D A
Is having the best day   of  my life
