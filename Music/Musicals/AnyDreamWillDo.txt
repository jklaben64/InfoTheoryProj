I closed my eyes

^E       ^E      ^D     ^C-G
Drew back the curtain

^C  B      A      G-E
To see for certain

F        F         E      D      G
What I thought I knew

Far far away,

Someone was weeping

With golden lining

Bright colours shining

Wonderful and new

The dawn was breaking

Any dream will do

A crash of drums

A     ^C     A      ^D
A flash of light

My golden coat

A        ^C    ^C     ^D
Flew out of sight

The colours faded into darkness

I was left alone
