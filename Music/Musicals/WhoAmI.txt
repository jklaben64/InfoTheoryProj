Why should I save his hide?

Why should I right this wrong?

When I have come so far  ~

And struggled for so long?

If I am not free?

Pretend I do not see his agony?

This   innocent   who wears my face

Who goes to judgement in my place...

Pretend I'm not the man I was before?

And must my name until I die

Be no more than an alibi?

And so Javert, you see it's true
