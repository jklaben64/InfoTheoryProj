I dreamed a dream in times gone by

F                F        F       F        F     G        A       D-F
When hope was high and life worth living

A        A             A       A        G      A-Bb   ^C
I dreamed, that love would never die

A         A           A       A         A     Bb    ^C-D-F
I dreamed that God would be forgiving...

 

F       F     F         F         E       F-G-A
Then I was young and unafraid

F                    F          F           F        F        G       A       D-F
When dreams were made and used and wasted

A             A     A      A-G    A   Bb   ^C
There was no ransom to be paid

A        A        A-A       A     Bb     ^C-D-F
No song unsung, no wine untasted...

 

F#     G    A-F#       D    C     .Bb
But the tigers come at night

F#         G       A-F#     D    C    .Bb-G
With their voices soft as thunder

E        F       G      E       C     .Bb-.A
As they tear your hope apart

E       F        G        F         E     G    F-G-A
As they turn your dream to shame....

 

F         F     F      F-E      F     G     A
He slept a summer by my side

F          F      F        F       F         G-A        D-F
He filled my days with endless wonder

A         A     A        A - G      A   Bb  ^C
He took my childhood in his stride

A      A      A       A         G           G-F          F
But he was gone when Autumn came...

 

G        G     G     G      F#      G     A     B
And still I dream he'll come to me

G         G     G     G     G      A        B-E-G
That we will live the years together

B           B       B         B         A      B-^C   ^D
But there are dreams that cannot be

B            B       B         B        B    ^C-^D     E-G
And there are storms we cannot weather

 

B   B   B    ^C      B      A      B       G
I had a dream my life would be

B       B - B       ^C      B      A     ^D    B-A-G
So different from this hell I'm living....

B       B - B           B       A        B    ^C     ^D
So different now from what it seemed

B          B     B       B        A        A
Now life has killed the dream

G       G
I dreamed....
