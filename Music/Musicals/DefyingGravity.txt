 

D  -  C#          D            A        D-C#   .A
Something has changed within me

D   -   C#      D    .B    .A     .A
Something is not the same

D            C#       D        A - D   C#   .A  ^D
I'm through with playing by the rules

^C#     A - D    D-E    E-D
Of someone else's game

 

G        G    F#     D - .A     .G - D
Too late for second guessing

G       G   G   F#   D    B-F#   A
Too late to go back to sleep

G        G     F#    E     D      D-.A
It's time to trust my instincts,

G          F#    E-D    E     A
Close my eyes and leap

 

A      A   ^E  ^D  F#-A-D  F#-E-E
It's time to try defying gravity

A    A   ^E  ^D  F#-A-^D   F#-E-E
I think I'll try defying gravity

D        G     F#       E      D      D
And you can't pull me down

 

A           G        F#-G-F#    D-.A
I'm through accepting limits

D             C#-D       .B      .A        .A
'Cause somone says they're so.

D            C#    D     A-D       C#     .A   ^D
Some things I cannot change but 'till

^C# A B   D-E   E-D
I try, I'll never know

 

A        G     F#    D      .A-.G
Too long I've been afraid

D     G-F#    G   F#   D    B      A
Of losing love I guess I've lost

G      G    F#       E
Well if that's love

D      D    .A     G       F#     E    D    A
It comes at much too high a cost

 

A     A-^E   ^D   F#-A-D   F#-E-E
I'd sooner try defying gravity

A        A    ^E-^D
Kiss me goodbye

F#   G-A-^D  F#-E-E
I'm defying gravity

D         G     F#      E      D     D
And you can't pull me down...
