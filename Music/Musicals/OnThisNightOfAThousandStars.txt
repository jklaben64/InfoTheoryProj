On this night of a thousand stars

F#     G      A     G    F#    E - D       D
Let me take you to heaven's door

B             ^C  ^D-B    G     B       A -^C
Where the music of love's guitars

Plays for evermore

I never dreamed that a kiss

Could be as sweet as this

But now I know that it can

I used to wander alone

G  -  A      B    C    C    C     C
Without a love of my own

C  C   D     C   -   B       B
I was a desperate man...

But all my grief disappeared

And all the sorrow I'd feared

Wasn't there anymore   ~

On that magical day

When you first came my way

Mi amor!

Let me take you to heaven's door

Where the music of love's guitars
