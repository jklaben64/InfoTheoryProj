^D    ^E     ^C      Bb
You have come here

^D ^D-^E  ^E  ^E   ^C-^C    Bb
In pursuit of your deepest urge

Bb  Bb-^C  ^C  ^C  G#
In pursuit of that wish

G#        G#    F#    F#    F#
Which till now has been

E-E        D-D
Silent, silent...

 

^E  ^F#  ^D#   ^C#
I have brought you

^E    ^E   ^F#-^F#  ^F#  ^D#  ^D#  ^C#
That our passions may fuse and merge

^C# ^C#  ^D#  ^D#   ^D#-B-B
In  your  mind  you've  already

B  -  B               A     B
Succumbed to me

^C#       ^C#   ^C#-^D#-^D#
Dropped all defenses

^D# - B - B          B - B         A    A
Completely succumbed to me

A           G      G      G      G      G
Now you are here with me

G        F - F           F
No second thoughts...

F          F-D#-D#   D#-D-D
You've decided, decided...

 

C         F        E      F    G   G#-G
Past the point of no return

F          G - F          A-^C
No backward glances

^D#      ^D#   ^F   ^C#  ^C-Bb
These games of make-believe

^C ^C# ^D# ^C
Are  at  an  end...

 

C        F           E       F   G  G#   G
Past all thought of if or when

F       G    F-A-^C
No use resisting

^D#-^D#-^F   ^C#    ^C    Bb
Abandon    thought   and   let

^C     ^C#    ^D#-^C
The dream descend...

 

^C     ^C-^C   ^C
What raging fire

^C#      F     G#    Bb
Shall flood the soul?

Bb        Bb   Bb-Bb    B-F#   D#   D
What rich desire unlocks its door?

F#          B       B-^C#-Bb   F#    D-C#   C
What sweet seduction lies before us?

 

C         F       E      F   G    G#-G
Past the point of no return

F       G-F      A-^C
The final threshold?

^D#   ^D#   ^F-^C#-^C  Bb-^C
What warm, unspoken secrets

^C#  ^D#  ^C
Will we learn?

^C-^C   ^C#   F    G#   Bb    E-F
Beyond the point of no return?

 

^D      ^E       ^C       Bb
You have brought me

^D   ^D   ^E-^E       ^E       ^C     ^C    Bb
To that moment where words run dry

Bb   Bb    ^C-^C     ^C
To that moment where

G#         G#-G#-F#   F#-F#
Speech disappears into

E - E         D - D
Silence, silence...

 

^E ^F#  ^D# ^C#
I have come here

^E-^E   ^F#-^F#  ^F# ^D#-^D# ^C#
Hardly   knowing   the   reason   why

^C# ^C# ^D#
In   my   mind

^D#  ^D#-B-B   B-B-A
I've  already  imagined

B   ^C#-^C#  ^C#-^D#-^D#
Our   bodies   entwining,

^D# - B - B       B     B-A
Defenseless and silent...

A         A   G   G     G       G      G
And now I am here with you,

G F-F F
No second thoughts

F F-D#-D# D#-D-D
I've decided, decided...

 

C         F        E     F    G   G#-G
Past the point of no return

F       G-F      A     ^C
No going back now

^D#  ^D#-^F  ^C#  ^C   Bb
Our  passion  play has  now

^C  ^C#  ^D#-^C
At   last   begun...

 

C        F         E           F     G     G#    G
Past all thought of right or wrong

F        G-F    A-^C
One final question

^D#   ^D#    ^F    ^C#  ^C   Bb
How long should we two wait

^C-^C#  ^D#  ^C
Before we're one?

 

^C       ^C   ^C    ^C   ^C#-F   G#  Bb
When will the blood begin to race

Bb     Bb-Bb     Bb       B      F#-D#    D
The sleeping bud bursts into bloom?

F#          B       B     ^C#   Bb   F#     D-C#    C
When will the flames at last consume us?

 

D         G     F#    G   A   Bb-A
Past the point of no return

G      A-G      B-^D
The final threshold

^F        ^F   ^G    ^D#
The bridge is crossed,

^D    ^C  ^D   ^D#  ^F  ^D
So stand and watch it burn

^D          ^D     ^D#    G    Bb  ^C   F#-G
We've passed the point of no return...
