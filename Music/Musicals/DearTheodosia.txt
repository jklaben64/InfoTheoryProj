Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?

A      ^C#  ^E  ^C#
You have my eyes

^C#  ^C#     B       A-^E       ^C#
You have your mother's name

A             B      ^C#   A-A     A     A
When you came into the world

^C#   G#      E    E      E       B     A-F#
You cried, and it broke my heart

 

^C#  B-A-G#-A   E-E  ^E ^C#  B
I'm dedicating every day to you

A-^C#-^E ^C# ^C# ^C#-B  A  ^E  ^C#
Domestic life was never quite my style

A             B    ^C#   ^C#  ^F#  ^E  ^F#
When you smile you knock me out

^E ^F# ^E-^C#
I fall apart...

A    A    ^F#  ^E  ^C#  A-B   A
And I thought I was so smart

 

E        E         B      A     B     A       B        A         B-A
You will come of age with our young nation

We'll bleed and fight for you

B             A      B  ^C# ^E ^C#-B
We'll make it right for you...

E    E    B  A    B        A - B         E - B - A
If we lay a strong enough foundation

E            E    E ^C# ^E ^C#
We'll pass it on to you

B            A     B     ^C#   ^E ^C#-B
We'll give the world to you

 

^C#   ^E     ^F#  ^E ^C#  B-B-A
And you'll blow us all away

E  -  B           ^C#-A
Someday, someday

Someday, someday...

 

A    G#-G#    G#     G#    A
Oh Philip, when you smile

G# F# E-F#
I am undone

E      F#     F#  ^C# ^D ^E
My son, look at my son!

^F#   ^E ^E   ^E   ^E    ^D  ^C#-B   A
Pride is not the word I'm looking for

 

A          A   A      A         A       A-A   ^C#-^D  ^C#
There is so much more inside me now

A    G#-G#   G#    G#-A     G#      F#-E    F#
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun

E      F#     ^C#   ^D   ^E    E   A   B-^C#
My son, when you smile I fall apart

A    F#      A      F#   A    B    ^C#
And I thought I was so smart

 

A       A-A       A-G#     E - A
My father wasn't around

(^C# ^C#-^C# ^C#-B ^E-^C#)
(My father wasn't around)

A    A        A      A   G#    E-A    G#   E
I swear that I'll be around for you

 

A   A       A-A-G#    E   A
I'll do whatever it takes

^C# ^C# ^C#  ^C#-B  ^E-^C#
I'll  make  a  million  mistakes

^C# ^C# ^C# ^C#
I'll make the world

Safe and sound for you

We'll make it right for you

 

E   E  ^E ^C#  ^E  ^C#-^E  ^C#-^E-^C#
If we lay a strong enough foundation

We'll pass it on to you

B           A      B   ^C#  ^E ^C#
We'll give the world to you

 

^C# ^E ^F# ^E ^C# B-B-A
And you'll blow us all away

E  -  B         ^C#-A
Someday, someday

Someday, someday...
