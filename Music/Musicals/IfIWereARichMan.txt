I'd build a big tall house

Bb       Bb   ^C   ^D   ^C-Bb
With rooms by the dozen

A         A    A      A-A     A     A     A
Right in the middle of the town,

A     G    G    G
A fine tin roof

G           G       A-Bb        A       G-F#
With real wooden floors below...

 

F#              G      A    Bb    Bb    Bb-Bb
There would be one long staircase

Bb   ^C-^D  ^C
Just going up

Bb      A     A-A     A-A       A-A          A
And one even longer coming down

A         G       G        G-G          F-E
And one more leading nowhere

D       F       A
Just for show...

 

F#   G   A     B        B        B
I'd fill my yard with chicks

B         B-^C     ^D     ^C
And turkeys and geese

B            A       A     A      A      A    A      A     A
And ducks for the town to see and hear,

G  -  G             G     G   G-A-B   A   G    F#
Squawking just as noisily as they can

 

F#       G        A
And each loud...

Bb  -  Bb          Bb  -  Bb
"papa-geeee! papa-gaack!

Bb  -  ^C          ^D  -  ^C
papa-geeee! papa-gaack!"

Bb             A      A    A      A-A      A    A    A
Would land like a trumpet on the ear

A    G   G  G        G        F    E      D-F         A
As if to say, "Here lives a wealthy man!"

Lord who made the lion and the lamb

Bb       A-G#    G     F      E      D    E    F
You decreed I should be what I am

Bb         A     G#      G       F        E-D-E     F
Would it spoil some vast, eternal plan
