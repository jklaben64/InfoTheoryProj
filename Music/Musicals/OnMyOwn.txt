 

.A     D    D
On my own

D - E - D         E     A-F#-E   D
Pretending he's beside me

.A   D-D
All alone

D   E       D       E     D     .B-.A
I walk with him till morning...

 

.A  -.B         D
Without him

D  C#  D     E       F#-D    F#
I feel his arms around me

D        G    F#    E     D    G
And when I lose my way

F#    E   D     G
I close my eyes

F#    E      D      .B      .A
And he has found me...

 

.A   D    D
In the rain

D           E - D            E        A     F#-D
The pavement shines like silver

.A    D     D       D      E-D    E    D    .B-.A
All the lights are misty in the river

.A    .B     .B - D
In the darkness,

D        C#    D      E    F#    D-F#
The trees are full of starlight

D    G  F#  E
And all I see

D    G   F#    E    D-G-F#    E   D-.B-.A
Is him and me forever and forever...

 

.A   D     D    D   D#-D   D#  F   F
And I know it's only in my mind

D      Bb    Bb-F
That I'm talking

F    D - D   .Bb   .Bb  C  .Bb
To myself and not to him

.Bb     G - G
And although

G    G     F#    G   A    B
I know that he is blind

B    A   G
Still I say,

F#         E    G    F#   E
There's a way for us...

 

C   F    F
I love him

F          G        F      G   ^C   A-G-F
But when the night is over

C    F    F
He is gone

F        G-F      G   F   D-C
The river's just a river...

 

C  -  D         F
Without him

F           E           F-G      A       F-A
The world around me changes

F          Bb     A      G      F        Bb-A-G
The trees are bare and everywhere

F          Bb        A    G     F       D-C
The streets are full of strangers

 

C    F    F
I love him

F       G-F      G    ^C   A-G-F
But every day I'm learning

A     G    A
All my life

A      A-A     B       B-^C-^C
I've only been pretending...

 

C - D        F
Without me

F          E         F    G   A      F-A
His world will go on turning

F     Bb        A        G    F    Bb-A-G
A world that's full of happiness

F     Bb    A      G-F      ^C
That I have never known...

 

C    F     F
I love him

C    F     F
I love him

G    G    F
I love him

F       G-F   G   A    A
But only on my own...
