I saved every letter you wrote me

F#       F#     F#-F#   F#   F#    E
From the moment I read them

.A    D      E      F#       F#
I knew you were mine

.A      D      E      F#       F#
You said you were mine

I thought you were mine...

Do you know what Angelica said

D          D     .A    .A      .A    .A-F#    F#-F#
When we saw your first letter arrive?

D       D
She said

"Be careful with that one, love.

You and your words flooded my senses

Your sentences left me defenceless

D       E      D    A-F#-F#
You built me palaces

E        E      E-D-D
Out of paragraphs

D        E        D-A-F#
You built cathedrals...

 

A      A - A - A      A      A-F#
I'm re-reading the letters

D         E        F#
You wrote me...

F#     F# - F#      F#     F#-F#
I'm searching and scanning

F#   F#-E    .A   D-E-F#   F#
For answers in every line

.A        D        E    F#   F#
For some kind of sign

.A         D       E     F#   F#-E-D
And when you were mine...

 

F#       F#           E       D       F#
The world seemed to burn...

F#-E-D-E-D
Burn....

 

A         A - A          A      A-F#    D       E        F#
You published the letters she wrote you

You told the whole world

F#        E          E          D     .A
How you brought this girl

In to our bed

In clearing your name

.A     .A        D-E      F#    F#-E-F#-E-D
You have ruined our lives     ~     ~

Do you know what Angelica said

.A           .A      .A      .A         F#        F#
When she read what you'd done?

D       D
She said...

"You have married an Icarus

D      D      F#       E       E      D    D    D
He has flown too close to the sun."

You and your words

Obsessed with your legacy....

A          A-F#-F#     D-E      D       A - F#
Your sentences border on senseless

D         E     D     A-F#-E
And you are paranoid

E     E-E       E-D-D
In every paragraph

D          E      D A-F#    F#
How they perceive you...

G-F#  G-F#
You, you

G-F#-G-F#
You...

 

A     A-A-A     A-A
I'm erasing myself

F#        D      E-F#-E
From the narrative

F#   F#-F#  F#-F#-F#-F#
Let future historians

F#-E       .A     .A-D-E   F#-F#-E
Wonder how Eliza reacted

.A           D        E       F#    F#-E-D
When you broke her heart...

D         D       E   F#  F#  F#-F#
You have torn it all apart....

 

F# F# F#-E-D  F#  F#-A-G-F#
I am watching it burn   ~

D-E-F# F#  F#-A-B
Watching it burn ~

 

A         A        F#   E      E      E   E-D    D
The world has no right to my heart

D          A       F#   E       E     F#   E    F#
The world has no place in our bed

D            A      F#   E       E       F#   E  F#
They don't get to know what I said

D      A - F#     E      E-D-D
I'm burning the memories

A - F#       E      E - D      D
Burning the letters that

D               E          D - E        F#
Might have redeemed you...

 

A      ^D - A   G     G     A   G-F#  F#
You forfeit all rights to my heart

A      ^D - A     G      G    A   G      A
You forfeit the place in our bed

A        ^D     A    G      G-A      G - A
You sleep in your office instead

A     ^D-A     A     G-F#-F#
With only the memories

F#    ^D      A      G        A
Of when you were mine...

.A   D      E       A      A
I hope that you burn...
