 

F              E        G        F - D - E
We've just been introduced,

E  E   G        F        E      F
I do not know you well,

F          E         G     F-D      E-G
But when the music started

F   -  D                E      G    F      E       F
Something drew me to your side.

 

F     E-G      F       D      E
So many men and girls,

E      E     G       F - E       F
Are in each others arms

F      G       G      G      G       G       G
It made me think we might be

B-B-A-A     G-F-E
Similarly occupied...

 

A         G#      A
Shall we dance?

A    G#    A         A     G#   A-E
On a bright cloud of music

G        F    ^C
shall we fly?

G         F#      G
Shall we dance?

G         F#     G     G          F# - G
Shall we then say "Goodnight"

D           F           E  -  A
And mean "Goodbye"?

 

^C      B -^C
Or perchance,

F              G     A    A-G#  A     E      G     F     G
When the last little star has left the sky,

G        F#    G    G   F#-G-Bb
Shall we still be together

A          G        F         E - F       E      F - A
With our arms around each other

G          F        E    F    G      D       E  -  A
And shall you be my new romance?

 

Bb    A      G       G-F#-G-Bb
On the clear understanding

Bb       G       A    G#    A     G#    A-^C
That this kind of thing can happen,

Bb       A       ^C
Shall we dance?

D         F       ^C
Shall we dance?

D         E         F
Shall we Dance?
