 

Bb-Bb
Midnight

A    Bb   ^C       Bb     G      Bb-Bb
Not a sound from the pavement

A       Bb     ^C    Bb    F       G - G
Has the moon lost her memory?

D#   F    G - F    D#-D
She is smiling alone...

 

D     F       F-C
In the lamplight,

D          D#-F         G
The withered leaves

A - Bb     A   G     F
Collect at my feet

D       .Bb     F       .G-.G   .Bb   .Bb
And the wind begins to moan...

 

Bb-Bb
Memory,

A   Bb-^C  Bb  G   Bb-Bb
All alone in the moonlight

A   Bb   ^C    Bb    F    G     G
I can dream of the old days

D#  F    G-F-D#    D
I was beautiful then...

 

D    F-F-C
I remember

D       D#   F     G       A
The time I knew what

Bb-A-G         F
Happiness was

D    .Bb      F - F     .G   .Bb-.Bb
Let the memory live again...

 

.A-D         .A - .G           .A       D    .A
Every streetlamp seems to beat

.A   .A-D-D-C    C-.G
A fatalistic warning

F  -  F             F - A
Someone mutters

G         F          E - E           E - G
And the streetlamp gutters

F           A     A    A    B     ^C-G
And soon it will be morning....

 

Bb-Bb
Daylight

A   Bb   ^C   Bb   G    Bb-Bb
I must wait for the sunrise

A   Bb    ^C   Bb  F   G   G
I must think of a new life

D#  F    G - F     D#  D
And I mustn't give in...

D            F          F          C
When the dawn comes

D - D#      F    G   A  Bb-A-G   F
Tonight will be a memory too

D   .Bb    F     F   .G   .Bb-.Bb
And a new day will begin...

 

F          Bb     F    D#    F-Bb    F
Burnt out ends of smoky days

D#       F      Bb     Bb    G#   G#-G#
The stale cold smell of morning

C#     C#-C#    C#
A streetlamp dies,

F-D#-C#    C   C    C-D#
Another night is over

C#-F-F     F    G    G#-D#
Another day is dawning...

 

^C# ^C#
Touch me!

^C  ^C#  ^D#-^C#   Bb   ^C#    ^C#
It's     so         easy        to    leave    me

^C  ^C#-^D#  ^C#  G#  Bb-Bb
All   alone   with   the   memory

F#  G#  Bb  G#  F#   F
Of my days in the sun...

 

F   G#   G#    D#
If you touch me,

F           F#-G#-Bb
You'll understand

^C   ^C#-^C-Bb   G#
What happiness is

F      C#   G#   G#
Look, a new day

Bb   ^C#-^C#
Has begun....
