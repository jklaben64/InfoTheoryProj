In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came

B         ^E          B        ^D ^C ^C    A      ^D        A       B
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name

D       G  B     B        A - A     A    ^D  A   B
And do I dream again? For now I find

B      ^E - ^D   ^C   B   A-G-F#  E   D#
The Phantom of the Opera is there

^C-^C    B      B
Inside my mind!

 

B        ^E    B- ^D  ^C   ^C     A      ^D         A-B
Sing once again with me, our strange duet

B   ^E-B  ^D-^C   ^C     A       ^D - A       B
My power over you grows stronger yet!

D           G          B       B        A       A   A      ^D       A - B
And though you turn from me to glance behind

B        ^E-^D   ^C   B   A-G-F#   E    D#
The Phantom of the Opera  is there

^C-^C    B        B
Inside your mind!
