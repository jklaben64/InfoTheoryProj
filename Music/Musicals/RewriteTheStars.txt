 

Bb    Bb   Bb   ^C   ^D
You know I want you

Bb  Bb  Bb ^C-^D ^C Bb D# D#
It's  not  a  secret  I  try  to  hide

Bb  Bb   Bb   ^C   ^D
I know you want me

Bb   Bb     Bb   ^C-^D   ^C    Bb    D#   D#
So don't keep saying our hands are tied

 

^C     ^C   ^C   ^C  Bb  A   Bb
You claim it's not in the cards

Bb   Bb   ^C-^D  ^C   Bb   D#-Bb
Fate is pulling you miles away

D#   Bb   D#   Bb    ^C    A
And out of reach from me

Bb     Bb    ^D#   ^D  ^C   Bb
But you're here in my heart

Bb   Bb   Bb  ^C  ^D ^C  Bb  G-Bb
So who can stop me if I decide

G        Bb     G    Bb-^C-^D
That you're my destiny?

 

Bb   ^C   Bb  ^Bb-^A  ^F  ^D#
What if we rewrite the stars?

Bb   ^C     Bb     ^G   ^F   Bb  ^C
Say you were made to be mine

Bb-^C       Bb    ^Bb  ^A  ^F-^D#
Nothing could keep us apart

Bb    ^C   Bb   ^F  Bb  Bb  ^F    Bb  ^C
You'd be the one I was meant to find

 

Bb ^C ^D ^D
It's up to you

Bb  Bb ^C ^D ^D
And it's up to me

Bb-^C   Bb  ^G    ^F   ^F  ^D# ^D ^C
No-one can say what we get to be

Bb   Bb  ^C    Bb   ^Bb-^A  ^F  ^D#
So why don't we rewrite the stars?

Bb-^C   Bb    ^F   ^D#  ^D-^C ^C
Maybe the world could be ours

Bb-Bb
Tonight...

 

.Bb   .Bb   .Bb   C-D
You think it's easy

.Bb    .Bb  .Bb  C     D    C    .Bb   .Bb  C
You think I don't want to run to you

.Bb    .Bb    .Bb     C-D
But there are mountains

.Bb    .Bb    .Bb     C
And there are doors

D         C    .Bb     .F        .G
That we can't walk through

C      C        C        C-.Bb-.A      .Bb
I know you're wondering why

 

.Bb-.Bb   .Bb    C-D   C  .Bb
Because we're able to be

.D#   .Bb  .D#  .Bb
Just you and me

.Bb-D#   D-C    C
Within these walls

.Bb    .Bb    G    F      D-F
But when we go outside

F              F-A       Bb     A      G     A
You're gonna wake up and see

F       C    .Bb     .Bb-.G   D#-D  C
That it was hopeless after all

 

Bb-^C    Bb   ^Bb-^A  ^F  ^D#
No-one can rewrite the stars

Bb      ^C    Bb  ^G   ^F    Bb    ^C
How can you say you'll be mine?

Bb-^C-Bb    ^Bb   ^A  ^F-^D#
Everything keeps us apart

^F     ^F  ^F  ^F  ^Bb
And I'm not the one

^F     ^F      ^Bb    ^F  ^A
You were meant to find

 

Bb   Bb  ^C ^D ^D
It's not up to you

Bb Bb ^C ^D ^D
It's not up to me

Bb      Bb-^C-Bb
When everyone

^G   ^F  ^F   ^D#  ^D ^C
Tells us what we can be

Bb     ^C   Bb   ^Bb-^A  ^F ^D#
How can we rewrite the stars?

Bb   ^C   Bb     ^F    ^D#  ^D  ^C
Say that the world can be ours

Bb-Bb
Tonight...

 

Bb Bb Bb ^C  ^D ^G ^F ^D
All I want is to fly with you

Bb Bb Bb ^C ^D ^F ^G  ^D
All I want is to fall with you

Bb Bb ^C ^D ^Bb ^F ^G
So just give me all of you

Bb Bb Bb-^C-^D-Bb
It feels impossible

Bb Bb Bb ^C-^D-^D
Is it impossible?

^D ^D ^D ^D#-^F-^F
Say that it's possible...

 

Bb    ^C   Bb  ^Bb-^A  ^F  ^D#
How do we rewrite the stars?

Bb   ^C    Bb     ^G     ^F   Bb  ^C
Say you were made to be mine?

Bb-^C    Bb  ^Bb ^A ^F-^D#
Nothing can keep us apart

Bb        Bb   ^C   Bb   ^F
'Cause you are the one

Bb  Bb  ^F   Bb  ^C
I was meant to find

 

Bb ^C ^D ^D
It's up to you

Bb Bb ^C ^D ^D
And it's up to me

Bb-^C   Bb  ^G  ^F  ^F  ^D# ^D ^F
No one can say what we get to be

Bb     Bb    ^C    Bb   ^Bb-^A   ^F  ^D#
And why don't we rewrite the stars?

Bb-^C      Bb   ^G   ^D#  ^D  ^C
Changing the world to be ours

 

Bb     Bb   Bb  ^C ^D
You know I want you

Bb  Bb Bb ^C-^D ^C Bb D# D#
It's not a secret I try to hide

Bb  Bb  Bb  ^C   ^D
But I can't have you

Bb          Bb     Bb     ^C
We're bound to break

^D   ^C     Bb      F       G
And my hands are tied...
