D          E-F#      E     F#-G
Come alive, come alive

D      E      F#     F#     F#
Go and light your light

D   .A    F#    F#   F#
Let it burn so bright

D - E        F#   E   F#    G
Reachin' up to the sky

D     E    F#-F#   F#
And it's open wide

D         .A-F#-F#-E
You're electrified...

 

D      E      F#      F#-F#   F#   F#-F#-F#
And the world becomes a fantasy

E           F#         G          G      G        G    G-G   G
And you're more than you could ever be

E                   F#          G-G
'Cause you're dreaming

G            A      F-E     D      D-.A
With your eyes wide open!

 

D         E       F#      F#   F#    F#   F#   F#-F#
And you know you can't go back again

E    F#      G         G      G      G      G-G    G
To the world that you were living in

'Cause you're dreaming

G            A      F-E     D      D-.A
With your eyes wide open

So, come alive...

 

A ^D  ^E  ^F#    A     ^C
I   see   it   in   your   eyes

A          B-C       B    A
You believe that lie

G           A     Bb    A      G      A       F#
That you need to hide your face

A-^D   ^E  ^F#   A-^C
Afraid to step outside

A      B    ^C    B     A
So you lock the door

G      Bb      ^C   ^D   ^G   ^F#
But don't you stay that way!
