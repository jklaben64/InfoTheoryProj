Think of me, think of me fondly

D               D        D      ^D - A
When we've said goodbye

G - F# - G     F#      E     E   E     A
Remember me, once in a while

F#              D - D      D     ^D     A
Please, promise me you'll try!

When you find that once again you long

B     ^C#  ^E     ^E      ^D      B    F#    E
To take your heart back and be free

D   E   F#-G  F#   B   A-F#
If you ever find a moment

E          F#      G       C#    D
Spare a thought for me...

We never said "our love was evergreen"

B    ^C#  ^E-^E-^D   B   F#   E
Or "as unchanging as the sea"

D     E    F#   G    F#    B - A - F#
But if you can still remember,

E          F#     G   ^C#  ^D
Stop and think of me!
