 

E  G#  G#  G#  F#-F#  E   E
I saw the sun begin to dim

E          A      A      A-G#    A
And felt that winter wind

G#       G#
Blow cold...

E    G#     G#      F#    F#    E      E      E
A man learns who is there for him

E              E      A-A       A
When the glitter fades

E         E        A         B       G#
And the walls won't hold...

 

B             ^C#     B    G#-F#
'Cause from that rubble

C#          E-G#
What remains

B   ^C#-B  G#   F#     G#
Can only be what's true

B ^C#  B   G#
If all was lost

E    C#   A   G#
Is more I gain

F#        G#   A  G#    F#   E    E
'Cause it led me back to you...

 

^E    ^D#  ^C#
From now on

^E      ^E  ^D# ^D# ^C#
These eyes will not be

^C#-B     B    G#   G#
Blinded by the lights...

^E    ^D# ^C#
From now on

^E       ^E-^D#  ^D#  ^C#-^C#-B
What's waited till tomorrow

^C#    G#-G#

E     G#      G#-G#
I drank champagne

F#         F#      E         E
With kings and queens

E        A-A-A-G#       A      G#     G#
The politicians praised my name

E        G#     G#     G#-F#    F#-E       E
But those are someone else's dreams

E         A-A     A     G#  ^C#  B   ^C#-G#-F#
The pitfalls of the man I became   ~

 

B   ^C#   B-G#   G#
For years and years

E      A          A         G#
I chased their cheers

B    ^C#-B     B
The crazy speed

G#  ^C#-B     B-G#     F#
Of always needing more

B      ^C#  ^E  ^E  ^E   ^F#   ^E  ^E
But when I stop and see you here

^E ^E-^A-^A ^G# ^F# ^E ^D# ^E
I remember who all this was for!

 

E       ^E  ^D#  ^C#
And from now on

^E      ^E   ^D#  ^D#  ^C# ^C#-B  B  G#  G#
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights

^E  ^D# ^C#-B
From now on
