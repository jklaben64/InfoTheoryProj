 

G     G      G   G-G
It won't be easy,

G            G     ^C      A
You'll think it strange

A          A  A   A     A - A      A    G  G
When I try to explain how I feel

D      E    F       F         F         F
That I still need your love

F - F    F      E      D     E
After all that I've done...

 

E           E         G-A       E
You won't believe me

E       E     E      E   E  G   G    F#     F#      F#
All you will see is a girl you once knew

E  -  E            D            D         D    D     E      D
Although she's dressed up to the nines

D   D-D    D      A-G       F#     G
At sixes and sevens with you...

 

G   G  F   E    F    G-G     G  G  ^C      A
I had to let it happen, I had to change

A  -  A          A     A    A    A       A      G    G
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel

D - E          F    F     F       F - F         F - F       F    E    D    E
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun...

 

E   E     G         A - E
So I chose freedom

E  -  E           E - E       E - G      G-F#-E      F#
Running around, trying everything new

E         E - D         D  -  D        D   E   D
But nothing impressed me at all

D  D-D   D-A-G   F#  G
I never expected it to...

 

E            E     E     E     F-G-A-G
Don't cry for me Argentina

G          A    A G  ^C-G    F     E
The truth is I never left you!

E           F          G     D        D
All through my wild days

D       E         F-C-C
My mad existence...

C   D     C      E-G
I kept my promise

.G            .G       .G        .A-C
Don't keep your distance...
