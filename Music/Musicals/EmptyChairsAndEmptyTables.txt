 

A             A      B        A        G     F     F-E
There's a grief that can't be spoken,

A              A    B      A     G   F   E-G
There's a pain goes on and on.

G - G         A       G     F-E      E-D
Empty chairs at empty tables,

E          F          E          E       .B     C       E
Now my friends are dead and gone...

 

A            A           B      A    G-F-F-E
Here they talked of revolution,

A       A     B        A    G      F   E-G
Here it was they lit the flame,

G           G        A         G-F     E-E-D
Here they sang about tomorrow

E             F-E-E        .B-C     .A
And tomorrow never came...

 

C           C      C-C    D   C    C-.A
From the table in the corner,

C              D      D#    F   G      F-D
They could see a world reborn,

D         E          F        A       A-G       G-E
And they rose with voices ringing...

 

C  ^D  ^D   ^D   ^C#
I can hear them now

^C   ^D-^E    ^F    ^E     ^D      A      F
The very words that they have sung

^F-^G      ^F     ^E     ^D-A-F
Became their last communion

^C   ^C   ^D-^C   Bb-A-A     G    A
On this lonely barricade, at dawn...

 

A      A           B         A         G           F-F      E
Oh my friends, my friends forgive me

A      A     B     A      G     F    E-G
That I live and you are gone

G            G     A       G       F      E      E-D
There's a grief that can't be spoken,

E            F      E        E      .A    .B    E
There's a pain goes on and on...

 

^C#-^C#  ^D#-^C#   B   A     A-G#
Phantom   faces    at    the    window,

^C#-^C#  ^D#-^C#  B  A  G#-B
Phantom shadows on the floor,

B - B       ^C#    B   A-G#   G#-F#
Empty chairs at empty tables

G#           A          G#     G#    D#    E     G#
Where my friends will meet no more...

 

^C# ^C# ^D#   ^C#   ^E   ^D#  ^D#  G#
Oh my friends, my friends don't ask me

^C#   ^C#  ^D#-^C#-B   A  G#-B
What  your   sacrifice   was   for

B-B        ^C#    B    A-G#   G#-E
Empty chairs at empty tables

G#           A       G#    G#    D#   E    C#
Where my friend will sing no more...
