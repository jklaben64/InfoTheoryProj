E      E   ^C     B      A      B-A
Like a gift from the heavens,

E    E  ^C-B   A    B
It was easy to tell

E    E     ^C       B       A-B
It was love from above

G           G      ^D    ^C      B     ^C
That could save me from hell

 

G        G    ^C   B    A   A
She had fire in her soul,

G   G  ^C-B   A   B
It was easy to see

G         G   ^C-B     A-B
How the devil himself

G          G     ^D    ^C    B  ^C
Could be pulled out of me

 

E              E         ^C     B    A    A
There were drums in the air

G     A     ^C-B    A     B
As she started to dance

E-E      ^C   B    A     B
Every soul in the room

G-G            ^D    ^C     B         ^C
Keeping time with their hands

 

A        A     A
And we sang...

A    ^E-D   ^C-^D   ^E-A
Ay  oh-ay   oh-ay    oh-ay

A        A    ^E-^C    ^D
And the voices rang

^D   ^C   ^D-^E   A
Like the angels sing

 

A             A-A
We're singing,

A    ^E-D   ^C-^D   ^E-A
Ay   oh-ay   oh-ay   oh-ay

A        A     ^G    ^D   ^C-^D  ^E  ^E
And we danced on into the night

A        A     ^G    ^D   ^C-^D  ^E  ^E
And we danced on into the night...
