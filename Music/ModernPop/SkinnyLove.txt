Come on skinny love just last the year

G#   B  B-G# ^C#
Pour a little salt

B       B       B-E     G#-F#-E 
We were never here  ~

C#   E   G#  C#  E
My my my my my...

 

E - E     F#   G#  A     G#   F#
Staring at the sink of blood

E          .B           .B - C#
And crushed veneer

G#   B   ^C#   B   B    E   G#
Tell my love to wreck it all

G#    B   B   G#   ^C#
Cut out all the ropes

B     B    E    G#-F#-E
And let me fall  ~

 

.B   C#   E
My my my

.B     C#   E
My my my

C#   E   G#  C#  E
My my my my my...

Right in the moment

This order's tall...

 

E    E   B    G#   G#  F#  F#-G#
And I told you to be patient

E     E    B     G#  G#  F# E
And I told you to be fine

E     E    B    G#  G#  F#   F#-F#
And I told you to be balanced

E     E   B    G#  G#  F#  F#-E
And I told you to be kind  ~

 

E   E    B  - G#    G#  F#  F#  G#
In the morning I'll be with you

E       E    B   G#   G#-F#    E
But it'll be a different kind

E             E     E    B - G#
'Cause I'll be holding

G#  F#   F#-G#
All the tickets

E       E    E     B - B
And I'll be owning

G#  G#  F#-E
All the fines...

 

G#       B    B-G#  ^C#
Come on skinny love

B               B - E         G#
What happened here

G#-B     B   G#  ^C#
Suckle on the hope

B     B     E-G#-G#-F#-E
In light brassiere   ~

Sullen load is full on the split

And I told you to be fine

E    E    B     G#  G#  F#  F#-F#-G#
And I told you to be balanced

E    E     B    G#   G#  F#   E
And I told you to be kind

 

E         B    G#    G#  F#  F#-G#-E
Now all your love is wasted

E          B     G#   G#   F#  E
Then who the hell was I?

E          E       B - B      G#  G#  F#-G#
Now I'm breaking all the bridges

E      E     B   G#  G#   F#   E
At the end of all your lies.

 

G#     G#     B      G#
Who will love you?

G#     F#       E
Who will fight?

G#    B    ^C# ^C#-B
And who will fall

F#    F#-E
Far behind?
