I threw a wish in the well

B            B     B    B    B-A     B
Don't ask me I'll never tell

B       B      B    B    B   A  A
I looked to you as it fell

A          A       G       G   ^D   B
And now you're in my way

 

B        B      B      B     B    A   B
I'd trade my soul for a wish

B - B          B         B       B    A   B
Pennies and dimes for a kiss

B  B-B      B - B      A     A
I wasn't looking for this

A         A     G      G    ^D     B
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding

^D          ^D      ^D      B      A - G
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'

^D    ^D      ^D       B      A - G
Hot night, wind was blowin'
