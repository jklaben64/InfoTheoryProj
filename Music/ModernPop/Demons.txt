 

D#        D#   Bb     F       F
When the days are cold

D#    D#   Bb     F      F
And the cards all fold

D#    D#   ^C     G      F
And the saints we see

D#   D#  G#   G#  G#
Are all made of gold

 

D#          D#       Bb      F      F
When your dreams all fail

D#    D#    Bb     F     F
And the ones we hail

D#   D#   ^C    G    F
Are the worst of all

D#    D#    G#      G#     G#
And the blood’s run stale

I wanna hide the truth

Bb Bb-Bb  ^D#-^D  ^C
I   wanna   shelter   you

G         G     G      G      G-G#
But with the beast inside

G#           G#-G#     G#   G    G
There’s nowhere we can hide

No   matter   what   we   breed

We still are made of greed

This is my kingdom come

This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat

Look into my eyes

It’s where my demons hide

Don’t get too close

It’s dark inside

At the curtain’s call

It's the last of all

D#       D#    ^C       G       F
When the lights fade out

D#  D#  G#-G#   G#
All the sinners crawl

 

D#   D#   Bb    F         F
So they dug your grave

D#    D#     Bb - F - F
And the masquerade

D#       D#   ^C-G     F
Will come calling out

D#  D#   G#   G#   G#
At the mess you made

 

Bb      Bb-Bb   Bb   G     Bb
Don't wanna let you down

Bb Bb Bb  ^D#  ^C
But I am hell bound

Though this is all for you

Don't wanna hide the truth

They say it's what you make
