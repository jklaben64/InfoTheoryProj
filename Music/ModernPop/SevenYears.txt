Once I was seven years old

G    ^D-^F   ^C    Bb
My momma told me

G      ^C     ^C-^C      ^C        ^C
Go make yourself some friends

^C   ^C   Bb  ^D-^C-Bb
Or you'll be lonely   ~

^G  ^F  ^F   ^D-^F   ^C   Bb
Once I was seven years old

 

Bb Bb ^C  ^D ^C   Bb
It  was  a  big  big  world

Bb   Bb    ^C       ^D    ^F    ^C-Bb
But we thought we were bigger

Bb-Bb    ^C   ^D-^C   Bb ^C  ^D-^C
Pushing  each  other  to  the  limits

Bb   ^C     ^D-^F    ^C - Bb
We were learning quicker

 

Bb ^C-^D-^C  Bb-^C  ^D
By   eleven   smoking   herb

^C    Bb-^C    ^D-^F   ^C-Bb
And drinking burning liquor

Bb-^C  ^D  ^C  Bb   ^C    ^D
Never  rich  so  we  were  out

^C   Bb   ^C   ^D-^F  ^C-Bb
To make that steady figure

 

^G  ^G  ^F  ^F-^D-^F  ^C   Bb
Once  I  was  eleven  years  old

G   ^D-^F  ^C  Bb
My daddy told me

G   ^C  ^C-^C  ^C  ^C
Go get yourself a wife

^C  ^C   Bb  ^D-^C-Bb
Or you'll be lonely  ~

^G  ^G  ^F  ^F-^D-^F  ^C   Bb
Once  I  was  eleven  years  old

 

Bb Bb-^C  ^D  ^C   Bb
I always had that dream

Bb  ^C ^D-^D  ^F-^C  Bb
Like my daddy before me

Bb ^C ^D-^C  Bb-^C  ^D
So  I  started  writing  songs

^C Bb-^C  ^D-^F  ^C-Bb
I  started  writing  stories

 

Bb - Bb    ^C-^D  ^C  ^C-Bb
Something about that glory

Bb    Bb-^C      ^D    ^F   ^C    Bb
Just always seemed to bore me

Bb   Bb-^C  ^D  ^C  Bb-^C ^D
Cause only those I really love

^C  Bb-^C  ^D-^F   ^C   Bb
Will  ever  really  know  me

 

^G  ^F  ^F  ^D-^F  ^C   Bb
Once  I  was  20  years  old

G   ^D-^F  ^C  Bb
My story got told

G-^D   ^C   ^C-^C    ^C
Before the morning sun

^C        ^C   Bb  ^D-^C-Bb
When life was lonely   ~

^G  ^F  ^F  ^D-^F  ^C   Bb
Once  I  was  20  years  old

 

Bb Bb-^C  ^D  ^C   Bb
I   only   see   my   goals

Bb   Bb   ^C-^D  ^F-^C   Bb
I   don't   believe   in   failure

Bb    ^C   ^D   ^C    Bb-^C   ^D-^C
Cause I know the smallest voices

Bb    ^C   ^D   ^F  ^C-Bb
They can make it major

 

Bb  Bb ^C ^D-^C   Bb   ^C
I   got   my   boys   with   me

Bb  Bb    ^D   ^F   ^C-Bb
At least those in favour

Bb   Bb  Bb  ^C  ^D   ^C-Bb  ^C  ^D
And if we don't meet before I leave

^C  Bb ^C  ^D  ^F  ^C-Bb
I  hope  I'll  see  you  later

 

^G  ^F  ^F  ^D-^F  ^C   Bb
Once  I  was  20  years  old

G   ^D-^F  ^C  Bb
My story got told

G   G  ^D-^C   ^C    ^C-^C-^C
I was writing bout everything

^C ^C  Bb-^D  ^C-Bb
I   saw   before   me

^G  ^F  ^F  ^D-^F  ^C   Bb
Once  I  was  20  years  old

 

^G    ^F   ^F   ^D-^F  ^C  ^Bb
Soon  we'll  be  30  years  old

G        ^D        ^F     ^C     Bb
Our songs have been sold

G           ^D-^C     ^C-^C    ^C    ^C
We've travelled around the world

^C    ^C      Bb     ^D-^C-^Bb
And  we're  still  roaming  ~

^G    ^F   ^F   ^D-^F  ^C  ^Bb

Bb  ^C   ^D-^D   ^D-^C  ^Bb
I'm  still  learning  about  life

Bb   Bb - Bb     ^C       ^D-^F     ^C   Bb
My woman brought children for me

Bb Bb ^C ^D   ^C     Bb    ^C   ^D
So  I  can  sing  them  all  my  songs

^C  Bb ^C  ^D    ^F    ^C-Bb
And  I  can  tell  them  stories

 

Bb   Bb  ^C  ^D   ^C    Bb   Bb
Most of my boys are with me

Bb      Bb   Bb  ^C  ^D-^F  ^C-Bb
Some are still out seeking glory

Bb    Bb  ^C  ^D  ^C  Bb  ^C-^D
And some I had to leave behind

^C   Bb-^C  ^D  ^F  ^C-Bb
My brother, I'm still sorry

Soon   I'll   be   60   years   old

G   ^D-^D   ^F   ^D-^C-^C
My   daddy   got   61

^C-^C-^C   ^C   ^C   ^C
Remember life and then

^D   ^C   ^C-^C   Bb  ^D-^C  Bb
Your life becomes a better one

 

Bb Bb  ^C  ^D  ^C  Bb-Bb
I  made  a  man  so  happy

Bb    Bb    Bb   ^C  ^D-^C   Bb
When  I  wrote  a  letter  once

^F ^F  ^F    ^F-^F    ^F   ^D   ^D-^D
I hope my children come and visit

^D    ^D   ^C    Bb   Bb
Once or twice a month

Soon   I'll   be   60   years   old

G   G   ^D    ^F     ^C    ^C   Bb
Will I think the world is cold

Bb  G   G   ^D  ^F-^C  ^C  ^C-^C
Or  will  I  have  alot  of  children

^C    ^C   ^D   ^C-Bb
Who can warm me?
