When you hold me in the street

A         B    ^C#   B   A   G#    G#      A
And you kiss me on the dance floor

A    B    G#  G#   A    ^E    A     A
I wish that it could be like that

E           F#    A  ^E   A    A
Why can't it be like that?

A          ^D   ^C#-B-A-B
'Cause I'm yours ~

 

B     ^C#  ^C#-^C#  ^C#  ^C#
We keep behind closed doors

A - B    ^C#  ^E  ^F# ^E
Every time I see you,

^C# ^C# ^C# ^C#-^C# ^C#
I           die     a         little     more

A - B    ^C#-^E   ^F#   ^C#   ^D
Stolen moments that we steal

^D  ^D  ^D-^D  ^D
As the curtain falls

^D  ^D ^D-C#  A   B-^C#-B-A-B
It   will   never  be   enough  ~

 

A     B-^C#    ^C#   ^C#  ^C#  ^C#
It's obvious you're meant for me

A - B   ^C#  ^E ^F#
Every piece of you,

^E ^C#  ^C#  ^C#-^C#-^C#
It    just    fits    perfectly

A - B   ^C#-^E   ^F#-^E   ^D
Every second, every thought,

^D ^D ^D ^D
I'm in so deep

^D ^D ^D-^C#  A   B ^C# B-A B
But I'll never show it on my face

 

A B ^C# ^D
But we know this

^E  ^E ^F# ^E
We got a love

^D ^C# ^C#-^D
That is hopeless...

 

E         A      B    ^C# ^C# ^C# ^C# ^C#
Why can't you hold me in the street?

A        B   ^C#   B    A    G#   G#     G#     A
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?

A   B    G#  G#   A    ^E    A      A

E         F#       A   ^E    A     A
Why can't we be like that?

A         ^D   ^C#-B-A-B
Cause I'm yours...
