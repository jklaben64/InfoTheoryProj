You would not believe your eyes

If ten million fireflies

Lit up the world as I fell asleep

 

G           ^D   ^D  ^C ^D-^C G
'Cause they fill the open air

And leave teardrops everywhere

You'd think me rude

That planet earth turns slowly

It's hard to say that I'd rather

Stay awake when I'm asleep

.G            .A - C - C     E    D-C   .G  C    D
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs

G           A       A - G           A-^C     ^D
From ten thousand lightning bugs

G     ^E    ^D   ^C    G     ^E
As they tried to teach me

How to dance

 

G ^D-^D  ^C-^D  ^C   G
A foxtrot above my head

A sock hop beneath my bed

A disco ball is just hanging

By a thread

When I fall asleep

Leave my door open just a crack

Please take me away from here

When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

G ^D ^D-^C ^D-^C-G
To ten million fireflies

G        A          A      G    A     ^C-^D
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes

As they said farewell

But I'll know where several are

If my dreams get real bizarre

And I keep them in a jar

That planet earth turns slowly
