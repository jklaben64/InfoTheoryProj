Thought I found a way

G   G    A    B    B-A    A     G
So I guess I gotta stay now

 

A    B    A-G    G - E
Oh, I hope someday

F#    G   A    ^E  ^D   B
I'll make it out of here

A-B   A  G    E    F#     A
Even if it takes all night

A   B   ^E-^D       B
Or a hundred years

A        B      A      G     E
Need a place to hide

F#   G   A-B   ^E   ^D   B
But I can't find one near

A - B       A     G-E
Wanna feel alive

F#-G     A    B    ^E  ^D  B-A
Outside I can fight my fear

 

^B-^A ^G ^F#-^E ^A ^G-F#
Isn't    it    lovely,    all    alone?

^B       ^A    ^G   ^F     ^E     ^F#  ^E  ^G
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone

^B   ^A  ^G  ^F#-^E  ^A  ^G  ^F#
Tear me to pieces, skin and bone
