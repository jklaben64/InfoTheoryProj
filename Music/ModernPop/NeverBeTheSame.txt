 

E    -  G             G  -  E        G          G
Something must've gone wrong

G    E   A-G
In my brain

G       G      G - G - G     G  G   E    A-G
Got your chemicals all in my veins

 

G - G      G    G      G
Feeling all the highs

G      G     E    A-G
Feel all the pain

G    G   G    G      G
Let go of the wheel

G G G-E A-G
It's the bullet lane

 

G        G    G - G      G
Now I’m seeing red

G       G  -  E        A - G
Not thinking straight

G  -  G      G     G     G
Blurring all the lines

 

G   G-G-A-^C  ^D-^E
You intoxicate me

A-G   G   ^E-^E-^E
Just like nicotine

^E-^G-^E   ^G-^E
Heroin, morphine

^E-^G-^E   G   G  ^E-^G
Suddenly,  I’m  a  fiend

 

G        G     ^E   ^G  ^E
And you’re all I need

^E  ^G  ^E-^D-^C-A
All   I   need    ~      ~

G          G     ^E  ^G   ^E-^D
Yeah you're all I need   ~

 

^C  ^C    G
It’s you, babe

A   ^C   A  ^C-A
And I’m a sucker

^C    A   ^C    ^C     A    ^C         G
For the way that you move babe

 

A  ^C   A     ^C   A   ^C
And I could try to run

A  ^C    A    ^C   ^D-A-G
But it would be useless

G       ^E    ^D
You’re to blame

^F   ^E   ^C  ^C   F
Just one hit of you

E     F     E    F - E     F    E    ^C
I knew I’ll never be the same

 

^C  ^C    G
It’s you, babe

A   ^C    A   ^C-A
And I’m a sucker

^C     A    ^C    ^C    A    ^C       G
For the way that you move babe

 

A   ^C   A    ^C   A  ^C
And I could try to run

A   ^C    A    ^C    ^D-G
But it would be useless

A        ^E     ^D
You’re to blame

 

^F    ^E  ^C  ^C  F
Just one hit of you

E     F     E     F - E    F-E    F-E
I knew I’ll never ever, ever

F       E     ^C
Be the same...

 

E    F - E    F    E   ^E-^D
I'll never be the same

E    F - E    F    E   ^E-^D-^C-A
I'll never be the same   ~    ~

E   F - E   ^E  ^D   ^E
I'll never be the same...
