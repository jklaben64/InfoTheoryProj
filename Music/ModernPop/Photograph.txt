Loving can hurt

G#-G#  F#  G#-F#-E    E - E
Loving can hurt  ~  sometimes

E       E     F#   D#-D#  E
But it's the only thing

A    G#    E
That I know...

 

G#     G#  F#   G#-F#-E
When it get's hard  ~

E          E     F#   G#  F#  G#-F#-E    E - E
You know it can get hard  ~   sometimes

E   E   F#  D#-D#  E
It is the only thing

A         G#   F#   E-E-F#-G#
Makes us feel alive    ~

 

E        E        E       E     E   E   F#-G#-G#
We keep this love in a photograph

E          E         E           E-E-E       F#    G#-G#-F#-E
We made these memories for ourselves  ~

E             F#     B      G#   G#-F#   F#-E
Where our eyes are never closing

B            G#   G#-F#   F#-E
Hearts are never broken

B        G#-G#-F#  F#-E   E
Times forever frozen still

 

E      E     F#    G#    B   G#-G#
So you can keep me inside

G#-G#  G#   A-G#   F#   E       G#       F#
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans

G#-G#    G#   A-G#   F#   E    G#    F#
Holding me closer till our eyes meet

F#      G#    A-G#  F#  E-E
You won't ever be alone

E          E   D#   E      E         E
Wait for me to come home

 

G#-G#   F#   G#
Loving can heal

G#-G#   F#   G#-F#-E    E      E
Loving can mend  ~   your soul

E       E    F#  D#-D#   E     A   G#-F#-E   E
And it's the only thing that I     ~   know

 

E    E     E    G#   F#   G#-F#-G#
I swear it will get easier

E - E - E          E      E    ^C#-B-G#    F#   E   E
Remember that with every piece of you

E      E     F#   D#-D#   E
And it's the only thing

E         E      A    G#    F#    E     E-F#-G#
We take with us when we die    ~

 

E        E        E       E     E   E   F#-G#-G#

You won't ever be alone   ~

 

E       E    F#    G#  B
And if you hurt me

G#   G#-G# A -G#  F# -E  G#   F#
That's ok baby only words bleed

G#-G#   G#     A-G#  F#    E      B   G#
Inside these pages you just hold me

E    F#   G#    A-G#  F#   E   E
And I won't ever let you go

E          E     D#   E     E        E
Wait for me to come home

E          E     D#   E     E        E
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home

 

E       E    F#  G#  B
Oh you can fit me

B - B      B     G#-G#
Inside the necklace

G#    A      G#    F#   E-G#-F#
You got when you were 16

G#    G#  G#      A - G#         F#    E      G#    F#
Next to your heartbeat where I should be

 

F#    G#    A      G#-F#    E    E-F#-G#
Keep it deep within your soul

E      E     F#    G#  B
And if you hurt me

G#    G-G#  A-G# F#-E  G#    F#
That's ok baby only words bleed

G#-G#    G#    A-G#   F#   E     B    G#
Inside these pages you just hold me

E    F#  G#   A-G#  F#  E   E-F#-G#
And I won't ever let you go  ~

 

E        E    G#-G#
When I'm away

G# G# G#-A-G#   F#    E     G#     F#
I will remember how you kissed me

G#-G#   G#    A - G#     F#   E    G#     F#
Under the lamppost back on 6th street

F# - G#    G#     A - G#       F#        E        E
Hearing you whisper through the phone

E            E     D#    E     E         E
"Wait for me to come home"
