 

G#   G#   G#
I choose me,

G#  G#   G#    B       B-F#      F#
And I know that’s selfish, love

F#    F#   E     F#
You are a dream,

F#   E   G#      F#       E     F#-E
And I can’t thank you enough

 

E    F#  E
But I give

F#-E-F#    G#   F#   E   F#-E
Another piece of me away

E-F#    E-F#    F#-G#   F#  E  F#    E
Every wakin' day that I’m with you

 

G# G# F# G#-G#
Am I a monster?

G#       G#      B      B-F#     F#   G#  F#
What will your family think of me?

F#         F#       E     F#
They brought me in,

F#            B     G#   G#
They helped me out

F#        F#-E-E
With everything

 

E   F#   E
But I give

F#  E-F#  G#   F#  E  F#-E
A little piece of me away

E-F#     E-F#    E
Every single day...

 

E  F#  G#  G#  F#  G#-E
So I pick up the pieces,

E G# G#    F#   G#-B     F#
I get on the midnight train

F# F#   E   F#-C
I got my reasons,

C     F#-F#  E   F#    G#-E
But darlin' I can’t explain

E      E-G#    F#    E
I’ll always love you

E         E - B        G#    A
But tonight’s the night

G#   A     G#   F#    E-E
I choose to walk away...
