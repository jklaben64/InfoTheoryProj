In your eyes

There's a heavy blue

E       E    E-D    E     E   D   A-F#
One to love and one to lose

 

F#           A-A   B    E - E    E-D
Sweet divine, a heavy truth

E - E     E    E-D
Water or wine

E               E      D      A-F#
Don't make me choose...

With the stars in the sky ~

I've been running through the jungle

I've been running with the wolves

To get to you, to get to you

I've been down the darkest alleys

Saw the dark side of the moon

I've looked for love in every stranger

Took too much to ease the anger

All for you, yeah all for you

Your finger tips trace my skin

To places I have never been

Blindly I am following

Break down these walls
