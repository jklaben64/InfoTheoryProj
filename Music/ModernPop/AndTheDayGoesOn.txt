F#       F#  F#  F#  Bb-^C#
Woke up in the morning

Bb-G#      F#       F#-F#   F#   D#-C#
Travelin’ straight into the sun,

F#    F#      F#       F#    Bb-^C#
Told my friends  and  family

Bb  F#   G#
I   was gone

F#            F#    F#  F#   Bb-^C#
Looked back in the mirror,

Bb           G#-F#   F#  F#  F#  D#-C#
Thought about who I had become

^D#
And!

Bb ^C#  ^C#  ^D#  Bb-F#-F#   G#    F#
I don’t think that anything’s gone wrong!

 

F#            F#  F#  F#   Bb-^C#
Jumped out of my suitcase,

Bb    F#        F#- F#      F#      D#   C#
And went travelin’ down the road

F#         F#    F#  F#    Bb     ^C#   Bb   F#  G#
Went back to the place where I was born

F#-F#       F#    F#   Bb-^C#
Thinkin’ ’bout my future,

Bb-G#      F#       F#   F#    F#  D#    C#
Thinkin’ ’bout how far we have come

^D#
Oh!

Bb ^C# ^C# ^D# Bb-F#  F#  G#   F#
I don’t think I’m gonna be goin’ home!

 

Bb  ^C# ^D# ^C#  Bb-G#-F#
And the day goes on  ~   !

B      Bb     G#    F#
Goes on, goes on.

B       Bb
Goes on,

G#    F#    G#   Bb   F#
And the day goes on....

 

Bb  ^C# ^D# ^C#  Bb-G#-F#
And the day goes on  ~  !

B       Bb     G#    F#
Goes on, goes on.

B       Bb
Hold on,

G#    F#   G#   Bb   F#
And the day goes on...
