 

C# D# D# D#-D#-C#
I   got   no   excuses

C#  C#  C#  D#    D#-D#
For all of these goodbyes

C#    D#  D#   D#  D#-C#
Call me when it's over

C#      C#   C#-.Bb  .G#-.F
'Cause I'm dying inside

 

C#        D#    D#     D#     D#    C#    C#
Wake me when the shakes are gone

.Bb   .Bb   D#     D#    D#-C#-D#
And the cold sweats disappear

C#   D#   D#   D#  D#-C#
Call me when it's over

C#    C#-C#   C#  .Bb-.G#-.F
And myself has reappeared

 

C#  C#   C#   D#   D#    D#
I don't know, I don't know

F      F       F    G#   G#    G#    F-C#
I don't know, I don't know why

C# C# C# D#-D#   F-F   G#-F   D#
I   do   it   every,  every,  every  time

 

C#  C#-.Bb  .Bb  C#  C#-.Bb
It's  only  when  I'm  lonely

C#-C#     C#   D#   D#-D#   F
Sometimes I just wanna cave

F      F     G#     G#-F    D#
And I don't wanna fight

D# C# C# C# D#
I try and I try

D#  D# F   F  F  G# G# G# F-D#
And I try and I try and I try

C#     C#  .Bb .Bb C#-.Bb
Just hold me, I'm lonely

 

G#-F        G#   F  G#-F
Momma I'm so sorry

G#  G#  Bb-F   F-D#-D#
I'm not sober anymore

D#    F# - F      F#       F - F#    F
And daddy please forgive me

D#   C#   D#       F      D#   C#  .Bb-.G#
For the drink spilled on the floor ~

 

F    G#    G#    F      G#-F   G#   F
To the ones who never left me

G#          G#      G#      F      D#   C#-C#
We've been down this road before

C#   F  F#-F
I'm so sorry

C#  F   F#-D#-F-D#  C#-D#-C#
I'm not sober   ~         anymore

G#-Bb-F C#
Ooh ooh...

 

C# D#-D# D# D#-F D#-C# C#
I'm  sorry  to  my  future  love

C#   C#   D#    C#   D#  C#  D#
For the man that left my bed

C#   D#-D#   D#  D#  D#
For making love the way

C#  C#  C#  C#  .Bb-.G#  .F#  .F
I saved for you inside my head

 

C#  C#  G#-G# G# G# D# C# C#
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost

C#         D#       C#   D#  F-D#
who watched me fall again

C# D#-D# D# D# D# C#-C#
I   wanna   be   a   role   model

C#   C#   C#-.G#   .F-.D#
But   I'm   only   human...
