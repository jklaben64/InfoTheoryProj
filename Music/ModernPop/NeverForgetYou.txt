I used to be so happy

B     ^C#-^D  ^E  ^D ^E ^F# ^G ^F#-^E
But without you here I feel so low~

A       F#        A    F#   A     B
I watched you as you left

^C# ^C# ^D-^E ^D
But I can never seem

^E ^F# ^G ^F#-^E
To let you go~

 

A         ^A    ^E-^E  ^E  ^E
'Cause once upon a time

^E     ^E   ^E    ^E-^D-B
You were my everything

B     ^A   ^E   ^E   ^E   ^E
It’s clear to see that time

^E-^E      ^E    ^E  ^D-B-A
Hasn’t changed a thing...

 

A   F#-A    F#    A-B   ^C#
It’s very deep inside me

B ^C#  ^D   ^E     ^D-^E
But I feel there’s something

^F#   ^G  ^F#-^E
You should know~

^E-^D-B
Mmm...

 

A A ^A-^A ^A-^E ^D-B
I will never forget you ~

A      ^A-^A   ^A  ^D  ^E  ^E
You’ll always be by my side

A          A  ^A  ^A  ^A  ^E  ^D-B
From the day that I met you ~

A     A       A    A     A      ^A   ^A
I knew that I would love you

^A ^A ^D ^E ^E
'Til the day I die

 

^D ^F# ^A ^B-^A   ^F#   ^E     ^D
And  I  will  never  want much more

^D ^F# ^A ^B
And in my heart

^B ^A ^A-^F# ^D  ^E
I  will  always  be  sure

A  A  ^A-^A  ^A-^E  ^D-B
I  will  never  forget  you

A         A   ^A-^A   ^A  ^D  ^E  ^E
And you’ll always be by my side
