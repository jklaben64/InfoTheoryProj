The club isn't the best place to find a lover

E       E     E    E    F#   G# G#
So the bar is where I go

B      G#  G#    G#    G#   G#  F#-F#  F#-F# F#
Me and my friends at the table doing shots

F#-F#       F#    F#     G#    F#   E    C#
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

 

C#     C#    C#   F#-G#  G#  G#  G#
And you come over and start up

G#  G#-G#-G#-G#  G#  G#  G#
A conversation with just me

G#        B     G#   G#  F#  F#  E  G#
And trust me I'll give it a chance

F#-E      E     E       E        B
Now take my hand, stop

F#    G#  G#   F#   F#   F#   F#-F#
Put Van the Man on the jukebox

F#      F#    F#     F#    E     C#
And then we start to dance

.G#    .G#  C#  C#-C# C#
And now I'm singing like...

 

C#     C#     C#   .B   C#    G#    F#
Girl, you know I want your love

F#        F#    G#      F#-E
Your love was handmade

C#    E-G#-F#    F#  C#
For somebody like me

B          F#    G#    G#-F#  E   C#
Come on now, follow my lead

F#  F# G#   F#-E   F#     E    C#
I may be crazy, don't mind me...

 

C#     C#   C#    .B     C#   G#   F#
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

F#      F#   G#   F#     E     C#    E  G#-F#  F#  C#
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

B           G#   G#   F#-E    E     C#
Come on now, follow my lead

C#             B      G#   G#   F#-E     E    C#
Come, come on now, follow my lead

.G#-.B-C#
Hmmmm ~

E    F#    G#   F#    E       E     F#   F#
I'm in love with the shape of you

 

E        E       F#   G#    F#  E   E-F#   C#
We push and pull like a magnet do

C# - E      F#     G#    E    E-F#   F#
Although my heart is falling too

E    F#  G#   F#     E      F#-C#
I'm in love with your body

F#       G#     B      G#    F#   E    F#
Last night you were in my room

C#      E     F#     G# - F#      E       F#    C#
And now my bedsheets smell like you

C#-C#  C#   C#-E-F#-G#    C#- E       F#      F#
Every day discovering something brand new

E      F#  G#   F#     E    F#-C#
I'm in love with your body

 

C#  C#   E   E   F# F#   G# G#
Ooh I,   ooh I,  ooh I,  ooh I

Ooh I,   ooh I,  ooh I,  ooh I

Every day discovering something brand new
