A  A     G    F-D
I feel so unsure

D  D  A       Bb      G
As I take your hand

D        F       D    A   G      F       E
And lead you to the dance floor

 

D     E     D-F     A
As the music dies

D  -  E           F     D    ^C-Bb
Something in your eyes

A        Bb    A      Bb   A-Bb     A
Calls to mind the silver screen

F        A   G     F      E - D
And all its sad good-byes...

 

^F  ^F-^E    ^E-^E     ^E    ^D-^D
I'm never gonna dance again

^F-^D  ^F   ^D   ^G   ^F   ^E-^D
Guilty feet have got no rhythm

^F         ^F   ^F-^E  ^E  ^D-^D
Though it's easy to pretend

^D  ^E    ^E     ^E   ^C  ^D-^C
I know you're not a fool  ~

 

^C  ^F-^F         ^F       ^F-^E
I should've known better

^E     ^E   ^E   ^D   ^D
Than to cheat a friend

^D        ^F      ^D     ^F
And waste the chance

^D     ^G    ^F   ^E-^D
That I've been given

^F  ^F  ^F-^E   ^E-^E    ^E     ^D-^D
So I'm never gonna dance again

^D   ^E ^E  ^D      ^E     ^F-^E-^D
The way I danced with you  ~

 

^D        A    ^C-^D    A-G
Time can never mend

F        ^F - ^E     ^E-^D    A   G   F        E
The careless whispers of a good friend

D     E       D       F       A
To the heart and mind

D - D - D     F  ^C-Bb
Ignorance is kind

A             Bb    A-Bb     A   Bb   A
There's no comfort in the truth

^E   ^E ^A ^G ^F ^G-^F-^D
Pain is all you'll find  ~

I'm never gonna dance again

G -B          A     A-G      BA     G     E
Tonight the music seems so loud

G    B      A     A      G       BA      G      E
I wish that we could lose this crowd

E        G-G    G     A-A     G     G
But maybe it's better this way

E          F#     E      F#-E
We'd hurt each other

F#        E       F#      E       F#     G    A
With the things we'd want to say

 

D        B - A        A     G    BA      G-G-E
We could've been so good together

G        B - A       A       G      BA      G-G-E
We could've lived this dance forever

G       ^E-^D    ^D-^C    ^C-B      A      B
But no-one's gonna dance with me

B - A     A-G-E
Please stay ~
