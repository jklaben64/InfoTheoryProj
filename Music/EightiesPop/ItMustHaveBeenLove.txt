I gotta take a little time

A  G-A   ^C   ^C     A         G       B-B
A little time to think things over

G    E-G      B         A - A       G      G
I better read between the lines

A     G    A    B    B      A     G     B-A-G
In case I need it when I'm older...

In my life

E                   E           B - A        G     F#-E
There's been heartache and pain

G     G        A    E  E   E     B    A   G-F#-E
I don't know if I can face it again

B             A    A-G      E       B - A     G   F#-E
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far

E          G        B    ^C-B    G-D-E-D
To change this lonely life   ~
