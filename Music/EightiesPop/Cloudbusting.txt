B   ^D     G      E    A-A-E
I still dream of Orgonon

E    G    G   G-F#-D
I wake up crying

D            B - ^D      G      E        D         A    A     E
You're making rain and you're just in reach

E              G      E       G     E-G-F#   D
When you and sleep escape me....

 

E             G    F#   D-ED    A          B       E     D     D
You're like my yo-yo that glowed in the dark

G              G    F#   D-ED     A      B      E-D-D
What made it special made it dangerous

G  F# D-E  D    E   D-G
So I bury it, and forget....

 

E       A-A       A     A    G
But every time it rains

E              A       A    A    G
You're here in my head

E        E      A        A-A       G
Like the sun coming out

A       A   B     ^C        B         B  -  A          A      G    G - E     G - A
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen

E    G       G       E-D
I don't know when

A        B     ^C-B   B     A      A-G      G     E    G - A
But just saying it could even make it happen

 

B    ^D  ^D  ^D    G
On top of the world

E  -  D      A-A    A     E
Looking over the edge

G         E         G       E      G-F-#D
You could see them coming

D         B          ^D      G
You looked too small

E     D      A      A        E
In their big, black car

D   G  F#    G     G    F#   G    F#    D
To be a threat to the men in power
