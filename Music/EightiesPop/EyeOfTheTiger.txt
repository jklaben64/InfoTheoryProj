Risin' up, back on the street

Just a man and his will to survive..

So many times, it happens too fast

You trade your passion for glory

On the dreams of the past

And the last known survivor

F           D#    D#   F   G      F
Stalks his prey in the night

And he's watchin' us all with the eye

F    D#   F-D#
Of the tiger!
