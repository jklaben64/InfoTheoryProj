 

D       B-G       A     G    B-A
I'm gonna make a change,

B         A      G     A    E
For once I'm my life

D      G-A      B    B-A    A-G
It's gonna feel real good,

G-E           G      E      G-A
Gonna make a difference

B-^C    ^D   ^D   ^E-^D
Gonna make it right...

 

G   A    B     B    A    A-G
As I, turn up the collar

B-A    B     B-G       A-G     B-A
On my favorite winter coat

B           B     A      A-G      A      E
This wind is blowing my mind

D   G    A    B-A    A   B   A-G
I see the kids in the street

G         G       G-B    ^D   ^E
With not enough to eat

B     ^C  ^D   B  ^C  ^D
Who am I to be blind?

^D-^D-^C   ^C   B   A    B-A    B-A
Pretending not to see their needs...

 

B     ^C-B    ^C-B-^D
A summer disregard,

B    ^C-B    ^C-B   ^D
A broken bottle top

B   ^D   ^E   B   B-A-G
And a one man soul

B         ^C-B    ^C   ^C-B
They follow each other

^C     B   ^C    B    ^D
On the wind ya' know

B        ^D   ^E-^D
'Cause they got

^D-^E-^D  ^D  ^D
Nowhere   to   go

^D      ^D   ^D   ^D  ^E  ^G  ^G
That's why I want you to know..

 

^B    ^D-^E   ^G
I'm starting with

^A   ^B-^A  ^A   ^G   ^G-^A
The    man    in    the    mirror

^B  ^D-^E  ^G  ^A  ^B-^A  ^A  ^A-^G
I'm  asking  him  to  change  his  ways

^D  ^B-^A  ^A-^G
And    no   message

^G       ^E     ^G    ^G-^E   ^G-^A
Could have been any clearer

^F  ^D  ^F-^F   ^F    ^D   ^F
If you wanna make the world

^D  ^F-^D  ^F
A  better  place

^F  ^D  ^F  ^D  ^D-^F
Take a look at yourself,

^D     ^F   ^F   ^D  ^G-^A
And then make a change!

 

B ^C ^D 
(Na na na,

B ^C ^D 
na na na,

 B ^C    A A-G
na na, na nah)

 

D        B    G    A-G
I've been a victim

B-A  D  B-G   A   G   B-A
Of a selfish kind of love

D        B     G   A   G-A-E
It's time that I realize

G           G         A       B        A     B    A-G
That there are some with no home,

G     G    B-B  ^D  ^E-^D
Not a nickel to loan

B     ^C  ^D   B-^C  ^D
Could it be really me,

^D-^D-^C    ^C      B        A     B-A-G
Pretending that they're not alone?

 

B     ^C-B    ^C-B     ^D
A willow deeply scarred,

B-^C-B             ^C-B     ^D
Somebody's broken heart

B    ^D     ^E       B    B-A-G
And a washed-out dream

B         ^C-B    ^C     ^C-B   ^C    B   ^C   B   ^D
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see

B      ^D  ^E-^D  B  ^E-^D ^D ^D
'Cause they got no place to be

^D         ^D   ^D   ^D-^E   ^G   ^G
That's why I'm starting with me!

 

^B    ^D-^E   ^G
I'm starting with

^A   ^B-^A  ^A   ^G   ^G-^A
The    man    in    the    mirror

^B  ^D-^E  ^G  ^A  ^B-^A  ^A  ^A-^G
I'm  asking  him  to  change  his  ways

^D  ^B-^A  ^A-^G
And    no   message

^G       ^E     ^G    ^G-^E   ^G-^A
Could have been any clearer

^F  ^D  ^F-^F   ^F    ^D   ^F
If you wanna make the world

A  better  place

^F  ^D  ^F  ^D  ^D-^F
Take a look at yourself,

^D     ^F   ^F   ^D ^ G-^A
And then make a change!
