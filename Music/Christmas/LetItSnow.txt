C      C     ^C-^C      Bb-A     G     F - C
Oh the weather outside is frightful

G       F     G    F   G     F-E-C
But the fire is so delightful

D        ^D      ^D    ^C    Bb    A    G
And since we've no place to go

^E ^D  ^C    ^C Bb   A      A   G    F
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

 

C   ^C-^C     Bb        A     G     F - C
It doesn't show signs of stopping

G          F         G              F        G       F      E - C
And I've brought some corn for popping,

D       ^D     ^D     ^C        Bb     A        G
The lights are turned way down low

^E ^D ^C    ^C Bb  A        A  G   F
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

 

E            F    G-A-G     E    ^C - G
When we finally kiss goodnight

E        G    F     F-E      D    C   D      E
How I hate going out in the storm,

E      F    G     A-G      E    ^C     G
But if you really hold me tight

^C    B    A        B       A    B    ^C
All the way home I'll be warm!

 

C   C ^C-^C Bb  A-G    F-C
Oh the fire is slowly dying

G        F      G         F        G        F - E - C
And my dear we're still good-bying,

D     D   ^D  ^D  ^C   Bb   A    G
But as long as you love me so

^E ^D  ^C    ^C Bb   A       A  G   F
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
