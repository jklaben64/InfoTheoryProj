Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer

Had a very shiny nose

And if you ever saw him,

You would even say it glows!

All of the other reindeer

They never let poor Rudolph

Play in any reindeer games.

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

 

G          A    G     E  -  ^C      A       G
Then all the reindeer loved him

As they shouted out with glee,

"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
G          A     G     A     G - ^D-^C
You'll go down in history!"
