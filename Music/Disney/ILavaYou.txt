^C ^C  ^C  ^C  ^D-^C
A long long time ago

B            B    B   B-^C-B
There was a volcano

A - A    A    B-A
Living all alone

G    G   ^C-^C  ^C  G   B
In the middle of the sea

 

^C ^C   ^C   A-^C  ^D  ^C
He sat high above his bay

B  -  B           B    A     B-^C      B
Watching all the couples play

A        A - B       A     ^C   ^C    ^C - G      B
And wishing that he had someone too

 

^C    ^C   ^C  ^C-^D  ^C
And from his lava came

B         B      B       B       B    ^C     B     B      A
This song of hope that he sang out loud

A - B     A    ^C    ^C     G       B
Every day for years and years

 

A   A    A    ^F
I have a dream

A    G      G       G      ^E
I hope will come true

^C      ^D       ^D     ^D     B
That you're here with me

B      ^C   ^C   ^D  ^E
And I'm here with you

G   A      A      A      ^F
I wish that the earth

^F    ^F  ^G  ^E  ^E  ^D-^C
Sea, and the sky up above

^C   ^C   ^C     ^D - B    B  ^C-^C
Will send me someone to lava...

 

^C  ^C  ^C-^C  ^C  ^D-^C
Years of singing all alone

B              B    B-B   B-^C   B
Turned his lava into stone

B-A    A     B     A     G    ^C
Until he was on the brink

^C ^C-G-B
Of extinction

 

^C ^C-^C ^C ^D  ^C
But little did he know

B         B-B    B    B    B    ^C-B
That living in the sea below

A-A-A      A-B-A
Another volcano

G    ^C-^C-^C ^C  G    B
Was listening to his song

 

^C-^C-^C   A    ^C   ^D   ^C
Everyday she heard his tune

B       B-A     B     ^C     B
Her lava grew and grew

A  -  A        A       B - A
Because she believed

^C    ^C    ^C      ^C      G     B
His song was meant for her

 

^C    ^C    ^C  ^C  ^D-^C
Now she was so ready

^C     B      B     B - B   ^C   B
To meet him above the sea

B     B     A     A      A     B     A
As he sang his song of hope

^C   ^C   G     B
For the last time...

 

A   A    A    ^F
I have a dream

A    G      G       G      ^E
I hope will come true

^C      ^D       ^D     ^D     B
That you're here with me

B      ^C   ^C   ^D  ^E
And I'm here with you

G   A      A      A      ^F
I wish that the earth

^F    ^F  ^G  ^E  ^E  ^D-^C
Sea, and the sky up above

^C   ^C   ^C     ^D - B    B  ^C-^C
Will send me someone to lava...

 

^C-^C  ^C   ^C  ^C  ^D-^C
Rising from the sea below

B        B     B-B     B-^C-B
Stood a lovely volcano

A - A       A     B - A
Looking all around

G    ^C      ^C    ^C    G     B
But she could not see him

 

^C   ^C   ^C  ^C  ^C ^C ^D  ^C
He tried to sing to let her know

^C       B      B     B       B     ^C-B
That she was not there alone

B       A     A    A-B
But with no lava

A      ^C    ^C    G    B
His song was all gone

 

^C   ^C   ^C  ^C   ^C   ^D  ^C
He filled the sea with his tears

B                  B          B            B-^C-B
Watched his dreams disappear

B      A       A - B - B
As she remembered

A           A     ^C      ^C     G    B
What his song meant to her...

 

A   A    A    ^F
I have a dream

A    G      G       G      ^E
I hope will come true

^C      ^D       ^D     ^D     B
That you're here with me

B      ^C   ^C   ^D  ^E
And I'm here with you

G   A      A      A      ^F
I wish that the earth

^F    ^F  ^G  ^E  ^E  ^D-^C
Sea, and the sky up above

^C   ^C   ^C     ^D - B    B  ^C-^C
Will send me someone to lava...

 

^C   ^C    ^C   ^C  ^D-^C
Oh they were so happy

^C   B-B     B        B - B   ^C    B
To finally meet above the sea

A      G-A-B      A       A    ^C-^C   ^C    G      B
All together now their lava grew and grew

^C ^C-^C ^C ^C ^C ^D-^C
No longer are they all alone

^C   ^C-B-B   B     B     ^C      B
With Aloha as their new home

A          A        G     A-B     A
And when you visit them

^C  ^C   ^C    G       B
This is what they sing...

 

A    A   A    ^F
I have a dream

A    G     G       G      ^E
I hope will come true

^C   ^D   ^D    ^D    ^D   ^C    B
That you will grow old with me

^C  ^C  ^C  ^C   ^C  ^D  ^E
And I will grow old with you

 

A        A          A     ^F
We thank the earth

^F     ^F   ^G  ^E  ^E  ^D    ^C
Sea, and the sky we thank too

^C ^D-B ^C
I lava you...

^C ^D-B ^D-^C
I lava you...

^C ^D-^G ^E
I lava you...
