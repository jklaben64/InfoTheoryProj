D                B - ^C             A         D      A-B       G
There's something sweet and almost kind

D      B    ^C     A
But he was mean

D       B   ^C       A        D    F#-^E-^D
And he was coarse and unrefined

G         G    ^D     ^C   ^C   ^C  ^D-B
And now he's dear and so unsure

B    B-^C     A    D   A-B   A   D    F#     A-G
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

 

D          B         ^C       A    D      A      B    G
She glanced this way, I thought I saw

D          B      ^C        A
And when we touched

D      A-^C     A - D     F#  ^E  ^D
She didn't shudder at my paw

G    G   ^D  ^C  ^C  ^C  ^D-B
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore

B        B      ^C     A-D
But then she's never

A             B     A      D    F#    A-G
Looked at me that way before

 

^E    ^E   ^F#  ^G  ^F#-^F#-^D
New,  and  a  bit  alarming

^D       ^E   ^F#-^E
Who'd have ever

B                 G      A     ^E     ^D
Thought that this could be?

^E        ^E   ^F#  ^A    ^G     ^F#-^D
True, that he's no Prince Charming

^D      ^E        ^F#-^E      B     G
But there's something in him

G      B   ^E-B    G-B   ^D
That I simply didn't see...

 

D             B        ^C           A
Well, who'd have thought?

D            G       B     A
Well, bless my soul

D             F#        A          G
Well, who'd have known?

D         F#      A - G
Well, who indeed?

D            G         B           A
And who'd have guessed

D               A       ^C-A-D     F#   ^E    ^D
They'd come together on their own?

D    G   B-^E-^D
It's so peculiar...

 

^D      ^D    ^E   ^C   ^C  ^C  ^D     B
We'll wait and see a few days more

B            B      ^C      A  -  E           G
There may be something there

B         A - D       F#      A-G
That wasn't there before

D  -  G            B          A  -  D            G
Perhaps there's something there

B          A - D      F#      A-G
That wasn't there before...
