C      C-C     D    F    A-G      F
I'm gonna be a mighty king

C       D-F-F     G - F
So enemies beware

C         C      D-F       F     F    G#   G    F
Well I've never seen a king of beasts

F          G#   G#  G#-G   F
With quite so little hair

 

C     C - C    D    F        A      G-F
I'm gonna be the main event

C       D      F       F     G - F
Like no king was before

D       D - F       F     D    G#-G       F
I'm brushing up on looking down

F        A - F       F    F       F
I'm working on my roar

C         D    F    F-F       F-F-A-F        G
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing

D    F   G#   G-F   ^C   G   F     F
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

 

D - F        F - F       G     F
No-one saying "do this"

D - F        F - F        A     G
No-one saying "be there"

D - F        F - F         A       G
No-one saying "stop that"

D - F        F - F        Bb     A
No-one saying "see here"

D        F     F    D - F    A-F   G
Free to run around all day

G#   G#  G  F  G   G-F  F
Free to do it all my way

 

C    C     C       F        F      A     G   F
I think it's time that you and I

F  -  A        G      F      G      F
Arranged a heart to heart

D             F          F       D - F
Kings don't need advice

G         F-G        A - A       A    G    F
From little horn-bills for a start

C    F    F       F         F       G-F-F     G     A - A
If this is where the monarchy is headed

A            G      F
Count me out!

 

F       F      D - F     F    D   F-F-F
Out of service, out of Africa

F     A - A        A       G-F
I wouldn't hang about

C         F       F     F - F      F - F     A    F     G
This child is getting wildly out of wing

D     F   G#  G-F  ^C   G   F     F
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

 

E-G-G-G        A      G
Everybody look left

E-G-G-G         B       A
Everybody look right

E - G - G           G       B      A
Everywhere you look I'm

G - G       G    G     ^C - B
Standin' in the spotlight

D      E-G     G - G
Let every creature

G     G        B       G      A
Go for broke and sing

D           E    G   G   G    G
Let's hear it in the herd

G       B     G      A
And on the wing

D      E-G     G      G     G-G
It's gonna be King Simba's

B - G      A
Finest fling...

 

E    G  Bb   A-G     A     A  G     G
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
