All those days watching from the windows

^C   Bb        A        G - A       G - E     F
All those years outside looking in

^D  ^C   Bb   ^C-^F  ^C-F    A - G
All that time never even knowing

^C     Bb       A      F       G
Just how blind I've been

 

^C     Bb      A       G - A     G    E      F - C
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight

^C      Bb    A    G - A - G   E   F
Now I'm here suddenly I see

^D - ^C     Bb    F   ^E  ^D  ^C
Standing here it's all so clear

F        ^F      ^E      ^D    A  ^C
I'm where I'm meant to be...

 

^D  ^E ^F Bb  Bb  A  ^C
And at last I see the light

F       G      G     G   ^C   Bb  Bb-A
And it's like the fog has lifted

^D  ^E ^F Bb  Bb   A  ^C
And at last I see the light

F         G     A    Bb   A    G   F
And it's like the sky is new...

 

^D  ^E     ^F       Bb    Bb     A      ^C
And it's warm and real and bright

F          A      A       Bb      A - G         G - F
And the world has somehow shifted

^C  Bb    A     G - A - G        E         F -  C
All at once everything looks different

^C      Bb   A   E    F
Now that I see you...

 

^C    Bb       A       G - A        G      E      F - C
All those days chasing down a daydream

^C    Bb        A       G-A   G  E   F
All those years living in a blur

^D  ^C    Bb  ^C-^F  ^C-F  A-G
All that time never truly seeing

^C            Bb    A      F        G
Things, the way they were

 

^C        Bb       A      G - A    G    E     F - C
Now she's here shining in the starlight

^C        Bb      A     G - A - G    E    F
Now she's here suddenly I know

^D- ^C   Bb    F   ^E -^D   ^C
If she's here it's crystal clear

F        ^F     ^E      ^D    A   ^C
I'm where I'm meant to go...

 

^D  ^E ^F Bb  Bb  A  ^C
And at last I see the light

And it's like the fog has lifted

And at last I see the light

And it's like the sky is new...

 

^D  ^E     ^F       Bb    Bb     A      ^C
And it's warm and real and bright

Now that I see you
