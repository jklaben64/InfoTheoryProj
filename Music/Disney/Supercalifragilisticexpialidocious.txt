Even though the sound of it

E        G - G           A         G-G-E
Is something quite atrocious

G    G    G   G     A      G-G
If you say it loud enough

You'll always sound precocious

G  -  E      G   G     G-A    G     G
Because I was afraid to speak

E         G    G     A   G    F
When I was just a lad

G       G-G      G      G       A    G     G
My father gave me nose a tweak

E          G     G   A   G    E
And told me I was bad

 

G         G      G      G   G     A     G      G
But then one day I learned a word

G          ^C    ^C   ^D-^C    A
That saved me aching nose

A          A-A        A    A   B-A     A
The biggest word I ever heard

A     ^D  ^C    B   A     G
And this is how it goes:

 

G
Oh...
