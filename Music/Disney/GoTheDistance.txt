 

F#   A     B-A        F#
I have often dreamed

F#  A  B   A     F#
Of a far off place

F#         A       B       ^C#     ^D-A
Where a great warm welcome

D           F#     F#-G   F#    E
Would be waiting for me

 

F#            A          B         G       F#
Where the crowds will cheer,

^D         ^C#    B    A    F#
When they see my face

F#    A     B      ^C#    ^D-B
And a voice keeps saying

^D  ^E  ^F#  ^G   ^F#  ^G#  ^E
This is where I'm meant to be

 

^F# ^G ^A ^D ^E
I will find my way

^F# ^E ^F# ^G ^F#-^E
I can go the distance

^F#  ^G  ^A  ^D-^E
I'll be there someday,

^F# ^E ^F# ^G ^E
If I can be strong...

 

^F# ^G ^A-^D^ C#-B
I know every mile

^D       ^E     ^F#     A    A-G
Would be worth my while

F#   A     B      A      F#-A-^D
I would go most anywhere,

^F# ^F# ^G ^E ^D-^D
To feel like I belong...
