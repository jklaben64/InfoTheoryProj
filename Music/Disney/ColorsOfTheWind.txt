You think you own whatever land you land on

The earth is just a dead thing you can claim

Bb  ^C   Bb   Bb-G   G      F        F    D#     F - C
But I know every rock and tree and creature

Has a life, has a spirit, has a name...

You think the only people who are people

Are the people who look and think like you

But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger

You'll learn things you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry

To the blue corn moon?

^C  ^D#   ^D   ^D-^C    ^C-Bb   Bb    G    Bb
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?

Can you sing with all the voices

Of the mountain?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest

How high does the sycamore grow?

If you cut it down, then you'll never know...

For whether we are white or copper skinned

With all the colors

Of the wind...
