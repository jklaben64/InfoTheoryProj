There is a barber showing photographs

Of every head

And all the people that come and go

Stop and say "Hello"

On the corner

Is a banker with a motorcar

And little children

Laugh at him behind his back

And the banker never wears a mac

In the pouring rain, very strange!

There beneath the blue

Suburban   skies

In Penny Lane there is a fireman

With an hourglass

And  in  his  pocket  is  a  portrait

A   ^C     Bb
Of the Queen

He likes to keep his fire engine clean

Penny   Lane   is   in   my   ears

Four  of  fish  and  finger  pies

In summer, meanwhile back...

 

G-^C   ^D  ^E-^D
Behind the shelter

^C  B    ^C-B   A     G       A-G-F
In the middle of the roundabout

G    ^C-^D    ^E
The pretty nurse

^D  ^C-B    ^C-G     A   ^C   A
Is selling poppies from a tray

B       ^C       ^D      ^C
And though she feels

^C ^C  ^C  ^C  ^D  ^D#
As   if   she's   in   a   play

^C ^D ^D# ^C-^D
She is anyway....

The barber shaves another customer

Sitting waiting for a trim

From the pouring rain - very strange!
