Let me take you down

D              E     A-G    F      F - G - A         D
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

F  -  G    Bb   D
Nothing is real

D      ^D-^C   B    A      G#     A-B
And nothing to get hung about

B - G - E         B - G    D-A-G
Strawberry Fields forever

 

A - A   A   A-A     A       A          A
Living is easy with eyes closed

G - G - G - B - A        G    F#    G-F#-E
Misunderstanding all you see  ~

G     G - G       F#    E   D     B - G
It's getting hard to be someone

G    G   A   G-F#   E
But it all works out

G    G - G     A - G      F#    G    G
It doesn't matter much to me...
